# Rereading-LLM-Reasoning EMNLP 2024 Main 

⭐️ We are honored that Re2 is added into [optillm](https://github.com/codelion/optillm/blob/main/optillm/reread.py), a repo to optimize LLMs' inference.

- Intro: The official code for the paper **EMNLP 2024 "Re-reading improves reasoning in large language models"**. 

- Idea: *Simply repeating the question to get bidirectional understanding for improving reasoning.*


> Code will be availabel in the following two weeks . Star it and Stay tuned :) Or you can simply implement it because it is very simple.
